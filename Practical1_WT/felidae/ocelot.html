       <h2>Ocelot</h2>
        <p>Ocelot, (Felis, or Leopardus, pardalis), spotted cat of the New World, found in lowland areas from Texas southward to northern Argentina. The short, smooth fur is patterned with elongated, black-edged spots that are arranged in chainlike bands. The cat’s upper parts vary in colour from light or tawny yellow to gray. There are small black spots on the head, two black stripes on each cheek, and four or five black stripes along the neck. The ocelot’s underparts are whitish, spotted with black, and the tail is marked on the upper surface with dark bars or blotches.

	<h3>Natural History</h3>
	<p>Though larger than domestic cats, ocelots are small compared to jaguars. Adults measure about 70–90 cm (28–35 inches) long, not including the tail, and stand about 45 cm (18 inches) at the shoulder. They weigh 11–16 kg (24–35 pounds), with females being generally smaller than males. The ocelot is considered terrestrial but also climbs well, inhabiting tropical forests, grasslands, or brush-covered regions. Its traces can be seen as fine scratch marks on fallen logs and as tracks in fresh mud. Ocelots tend to be silent and adapt well to disturbed habitats; thus, they sometimes live near villages. They hunt chiefly at night, feeding upon rodents, birds, reptiles, invertebrates, and fish. Ocelots sometimes move about during the day, keeping themselves hidden in undergrowth, but may rest in more open sites beneath treefalls or among the buttress roots of trees.
