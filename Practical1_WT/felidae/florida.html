       <h2>Florida Panther</h2>
        <p>Florida panther, member of a population of large New World cats belonging to the species Puma concolor, family Felidae, confined to a small, isolated, and inbred group in southern Florida. This population is the only breeding group of pumas in the eastern United States. The Florida panther was traditionally classified as a distinct subspecies of puma (P. concolor coryi) and was reclassified as a population of the P. concolor couguar subspecies in 2017 after a genetic analysis. The preferred prey of Florida panthers is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); however, they also hunt smaller animals—such as wild hogs, rabbits, birds, and raccoons (Procyon lotor)—and larger ones, such as the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Florida panthers are threatened by various forms of human disturbance, including habitat fragmentation and degradation. Several perish each year in collisions with automobiles or other vehicles.

	<h3>Natural History</h3>
	<p>Florida panthers live in subtropical environments and frequently pass through wetlands, forests, and grasslands in search of food. They can use human paths and often cross roads and highways. Although the population is now confined exclusively to southern Florida, its geographic range once extended northward as far as Tennessee and South Carolina and westward as far as Arkansas and Louisiana. The fur of adult animals is dark buff, tawny, or rust-coloured above, brownish orange to light brown or tawny on the sides, and light buff to white on the undersides. Most male Florida panthers are relatively large, weighing 45–72 kg (100–160 pounds); females weigh 30–45 kg (65–100 pounds). From nose to tail, adults measure 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet). Kittens are buff with dark brown or blackish spots and weigh 0.5 kg (1 pound) at birth.
