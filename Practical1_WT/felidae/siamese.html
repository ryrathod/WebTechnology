       <h2>Siamese</h2>
        <p>Siamese, popular short-haired breed of domestic cat originally from Thailand, a country whose official name was Siam until 1939. The Siamese is a lithe long-bodied cat with slim legs and a long slim tail. It has a long wedge-shaped head and blue eyes. Some Siamese have crossed eyes or kinked tails, but these features are discouraged by breeders of show animals.
	</p>
	<h3>General Characteristics</h3>
	<p>Kittens are born white or cream coloured and later develop the dark points (ears, face, legs, and tail) characteristic of the breed. The points may be dark brown (seal point), blue gray (blue point), milk-chocolate brown (chocolate point), pinkish gray (lilac point), or reddish orange (red point). The colour and coat pattern are genetically recessive characteristics; that is, neither feature is apparent in the immediate offspring of a Siamese that is mated with some other breed. Despite the catâ€™s graceful build and relatively small size, the Siamese is muscular and agile. Characterized as affectionate and loyal, though sometimes destructive, it is regarded by some of its admirers as the most intelligent of domestic cats.
